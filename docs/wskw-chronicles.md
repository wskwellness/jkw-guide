# WSKW Chronicles

The WSKW Chronicles section of the Journal of Kinesiology and Wellness (JKW) includes conference materials and proceedings from the Western Society for Kinesiology and Wellness (WSKW) annual conferences.

## Purpose

The WSKW Chronicles serve as a historical record of the society's activities and provide a platform for sharing conference presentations, abstracts, and other materials that may not take the form of full research articles but still contribute valuable knowledge to the field.

## Types of Content

The WSKW Chronicles include various types of content:

1. **Conference Abstracts**: Brief summaries of presentations given at WSKW conferences
2. **Conference Proceedings**: Extended versions of conference presentations
3. **Presidential Addresses**: Speeches given by WSKW presidents
4. **Award Recipient Information**: Details about recipients of WSKW awards and honors
5. **Special Recognition**: Acknowledgments of significant contributions to the society
6. **Historical Documents**: Materials that document the history and evolution of WSKW

## Submission Process

Materials for the WSKW Chronicles are typically collected during and after the annual WSKW conference. Conference presenters are invited to submit their abstracts and proceedings for inclusion in the Chronicles.
