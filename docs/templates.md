- **References**: Format according to APA style for your specific reference types

## Template Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the templates:

1. **Formatting Problems**: Ensure you have the latest version of Microsoft Word
2. **Style Issues**: Check that you haven't accidentally modified the template styles
3. **Compatibility**: If using alternative word processors (e.g., Google Docs, LibreOffice), some formatting may need adjustment
