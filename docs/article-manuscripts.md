## Publication Process

All accepted papers will be published online shortly after being accepted. The JKW accepts submissions on a rolling basis, and papers are published as they are accepted rather than waiting for a full volume to be completed.

Full volumes are compiled and published once a year in January.

## Human Subjects Research

For research involving human subjects, you must include:

1. IRB Approval Statement: Explain that your research project has received approval from an IRB
2. Consent for Adult Subjects: If your study involves adult subjects, include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants
3. Consent and Assent for Child Subjects: In studies involving children, affirm that consent was obtained from parents or guardians, and assent was acquired from the children

These details must be included in the manuscript itself, and the IRB protocol number should be included in the cover letter.
