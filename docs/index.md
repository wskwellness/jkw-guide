# Journal of Kinesiology and Wellness

Welcome to the Journal of Kinesiology and Wellness (JKW) documentation site. This resource provides detailed information about submission guidelines, manuscript formatting, and the review process for authors interested in publishing with JKW.

## About JKW

The Journal of Kinesiology and Wellness (JKW) is the official publication of the Western Society for Kinesiology and Wellness (WSKW). The JKW accepts submissions on a rolling basis.

Full volumes are compiled and published once a year in January.

The JKW publishes several types of scholarly works:

- **Article Manuscripts** - Scholarly papers based on original research (experimental, qualitative, descriptive, and historical)
- **Article Manuscripts (Student Scholarship)** - Reserved for student-led scholarly papers based on original research
- **John Massengale Papers** - Invitation-only papers that reflect Dr. Massengale's outstanding contributions to the WSKW organization
- **WSKW Chronicles** - Conference materials and proceedings
