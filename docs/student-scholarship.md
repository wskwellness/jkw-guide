## Publication Process

All accepted papers will be published online shortly after being accepted. The JKW accepts submissions on a rolling basis, and papers are published as they are accepted rather than waiting for a full volume to be completed.

## Benefits for Student Authors

Publishing in the Student Scholarship section offers several benefits for student researchers:

1. **Professional Development**: Gain experience with the scholarly publication process
2. **CV Enhancement**: Add a peer-reviewed publication to your curriculum vitae
3. **Mentorship**: Work closely with an established scholar who holds a terminal degree
4. **Visibility**: Share your research with the broader kinesiology and wellness community

## Human Subjects Research

For research involving human subjects, you must include:

1. IRB Approval Statement: Explain that your research project has received approval from an IRB
2. Consent for Adult Subjects: If your study involves adult subjects, include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants
3. Consent and Assent for Child Subjects: In studies involving children, affirm that consent was obtained from parents or guardians, and assent was acquired from the children

These details must be included in the manuscript itself, and the IRB protocol number should be included in the cover letter.
